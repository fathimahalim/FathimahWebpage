    <p>&#128279; During semester 5, I had the opportunity to gain experience in conducting online talks using the Zoom Meeting platform.</p>
    <p>&#128279; We held a talk webinar for our final project about Career Guidance which has 4 slots which are Entrepreneur, E-sport, Content Creator and How to Make Resume.</p>
    <p>&#128279; Each slot is conducted by each group that has been divided in my class.</p>
    <p>&#128279; I hold a job as a Technical Bureau. So, I gained experience in handling every technique that runs throughout this event.</p>
    <p>&#128279; Our webinar received a large audience of all ages and each slot received a lively and fun response from the audience</p>

          <p>&#128187; For my group, we conduct for the second slot which is The E-sport Talk & Quiz slot.</p>
          <p>&#128187; We gave a talk on how E-sports can be turned into a career.</p>
          <p>&#128187; In addition to giving talks, we also provide quiz competitions by offering cash prizes to the first 5 winners.</p>
          <p>&#128187; Organizing this live webinar is quite challenging because there can be risks such as technical glitches or poor internet connection. But, we still get managed to handle this event successfully.</p>
          <p>&#128187; However, it such a great experience and this webinar gives me more self -confidence especially in communication skills that is when I need to talk to a lot of people.</p>
